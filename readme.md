## Adding exisiting rollups to agglayer

AggLayer is used to provide a common bridge for flow of messages and tokens between supported cdk and zk chains, it saves gas cost by first verifying the zk or validity proof before submitting it to the L1

## TODO -> Integrate Agglayer and op stack chains

As Opstack uses fraud-proof and optimistic execution they don't have any need for the proof aggregation but building a native bridge between agglayer can allow better cross chain communication.
